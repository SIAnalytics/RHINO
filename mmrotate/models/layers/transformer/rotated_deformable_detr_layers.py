        Args:
            query (Tensor): The input queries, has shape (bs, num_queries,
                dim).
            query_pos (Tensor): The input positional query, has shape
                (bs, num_queries, dim). It will be added to `query` before
                forward function.
            value (Tensor): The input values, has shape (bs, num_value, dim).
            key_padding_mask (Tensor): The `key_padding_mask` of `cross_attn`
                input. ByteTensor, has shape (bs, num_value).
            reference_points (Tensor): The initial reference, has shape
                (bs, num_queries, 5) with the last dimension arranged as
                (cx, cy, w, h, rad) when `as_two_stage` is `True`, otherwise
                has shape (bs, num_queries, 2) with the last dimension arranged
                as (cx, cy).
            spatial_shapes (Tensor): Spatial shapes of features in all levels,
                has shape (num_levels, 2), last dimension represents (h, w).
            level_start_index (Tensor): The start index of each level.
                A tensor has shape (num_levels, ) and can be represented
                as [0, h_0*w_0, h_0*w_0+h_1*w_1, ...].
            valid_ratios (Tensor): The ratios of the valid width and the valid
                height relative to the width and the height of features in all
                levels, has shape (bs, num_levels, 2).
            reg_branches: (obj:`nn.ModuleList`, optional): Used for refining
                the regression results. Only would be passed when
                `with_box_refine` is `True`, otherwise would be `None`.

              layer, has shape (bs, num_queries, 4)  when `return_intermediate`
              is `False`. Otherwise, Intermediate references of all decoder
